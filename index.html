        <p>
        My name is Nicholas Groth and I am currently a senior attending Flagler Palm Coast High School (FPC).
        I am an International Baccalaureate Program (IB) candidate, a part of the FPC weightlifting team, marching,
        symphonic, and jazz bands, and involved in numerous other extracurriculars including a club of my own creation
        (explained in more detail below). I have always had a keen interest in STEM as well as music and sincerely enjoy
        completing projects in these two subjects, both independently, and for the purpose of school.
        <br></br>
        Following my high school career, I hope to attend college and double major in mechanical and aerospace engineering.
        While attending college, I plan to continue feeding my passion of music by working with the music program of whatever
        college I end up at, and performing with local musician groups. This portfolio contains some of the projects I have 
        completed over the years whether for high school, or as an independent passion project.

        <p>
        Throughout the IB program, we as candidates, are required to do
        a project, or Internal Assessment (IA), for each class. On top of this,
        the IB program requires an extended 4000 word research paper, or EE.
        </p>
        <h5 class="section-heading">1.1 Opioid Epidemic Research Paper</h5>
        <p>
        When researching for the EE, I had always been intrigued by the war on drugs
        and the socio-economic, political, and criminal justice reprecussions as a result 
        of the war. In more recent years, the opioid epidemic has become a major public health 
        crisis in the United States, and the issues that addicts have suffered from have really
        resonated with me as a person. The research question I chose for this essay is:What are the 
        key differences and similarities between the opioid crises in California and West Virginia, 
        and how have these factors influenced the approach to managing the crisis in each state? The 
        goal of this research paper is to analyze the effectiveness of different treatment methods
        for opioid addiction, and to analyze how differences in resources can affect a state's ability
        to manage this public health crisis. You can view the paper <a href="" target="_blank">here.</a>

        <h5 class="section-heading">1.2 IB Chemistry Experiment and Research Paper</h5>
        <p>
        For the IB chemistry class, I have completed an experiment and accompanying paper to analyze
        the effect that varying voltage has on the process of water electrolysis. One of the passion projects
        (explained more below) is the HHO generator that I created. While the primary purpose of this experiment
        is to analyze this relationship, another purpose is to expand upon the initial project of the generator itself.
        The experiment and paper can be found <a href="" target="_blank">here.</a>

        <p>
        In the IB music course, there were numerous composition projects and a research paper to accompany the composition projects.
        Being so immersed in music, has caused me to have a great appreciation for all types of music. In writing the research paper,
        my goal was to gather music from all different styles and analyze the impact to the listener, or the other work of art the 
        music was created for. Following the completion of this research paper, I wrote numerous compositions on a variety of different
        instruments and also adapted music already created for a percussion instrument. Included above is screenshots from two of the compositions.

        <h5 class="section-heading">2.1 HHO Generator</h5>
        <img src="" alt=""/>
        <p>
        I have always been fascinated by the process of water electrolysis. This is the process of separating water into its component parts,
        hydrogen and oxygen, through the use of electricity conducted through the use of an electrolyte (in this case potassium hydroxide or KOH).
        There are numerous potential uses for the gasses produced, specifically hydrogen, including their use as supplemental fuel to internal 
        combustion engines. This specific design features a combined output, meaning that the gasses come out of one output together rather than separate.
        As a result, the gasses are highly reactive and I intend to safely experiment on building bottle rockets using this gas. In the future, I plan on
        creating a separate output HHO generator as well for separate future experiments using the two gasses separately rather than combined.

        <h5 class="section-heading">2.2 STEM Enrichment and Outreach Program</h5>
        <img src="" alt=""/>

        <p>
        Throughout my years of schooling in Flagler County, I have noticed a major problem in the education system: the lack of STEM oppurtunities for students.
        Fortunately, I was lucky and was able to participate in a STEM heavy class in 6th grade; however, past this enrichment, I have had no further STEM 
        enrichment. To try to give to my community what I was not able to receive. With the help of some of my classmates I have created a STEM outreach 
        program for students in Flagler County. 
        <br><br>
        To kick start the program, at the end of the 2022-2023 school year, we went out to one of the larger title I schools in Flagler County,
        Bunnell Elementary School. We ran STEM experiments/demonstrations with the upcoming 3-5th graders (current 2-4th graders) to start generating a greater interest
        in STEM in Flagler County. With the 4th graders we built spaghetti and marshmallow towers to demonstrate and tied in their standards of mass, weight, and gravity,
        with the 3rd graders we created oobleck to tie in their states of matter standard, and finally with the 2nd graders we created rain clouds in a bottle to 
        tie in their standard of weather.
        <br><br>
        For the start of the following school year (2023-2024) we plan on establishing a STEM enrichment club for the large title I elementary schools in the 
        county, Bunnell Elementary, Wadsworth Elementary, and Rymfire Elementary. Further into the year, we hope to expand this club into all fascets of Flagler
        County to provide all students with the STEM enrichment oppurtunities that encourage students to pursue carreers in STEM, or rather just have fun to foster
        creativity, critical thinking, and applied learning of topics in their school standards. Nonetheless, this project's mission is to provide all students of 
        Flagler County with the opportunities that many of my classmates and I were not offerred throughout our schooling in Flagler County.

        <h5 class="section-heading">2.3 Website Portfolio</h5>
        <p>
        Beginning at the start of 2023, I started learning web development through the CodeCademy platform.
        In doing this, I decided that the first bigger project I would create is this Website Portfolio. 
        Needing a place to document all of the projects I had completed throughout the years, and wanting to
        hone in my coding skills, I started the web-building process.
        <br><br>
        As this website is a an ever-growing document, it will constantly be updated with projects in the works,
        and newly completed projects. Learning how to code will be a necessary skill to have in the near future, 
        and by
