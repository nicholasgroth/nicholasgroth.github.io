        <p>
        My name is Nicholas Groth and I am an IB candidate senior at Flagler Palm Coast High School. All throughout 
        my schooling I have been creating projects both for the purpose of classes and as independent passion projects. 
        In school I am involved in the marching, jazz, and symphonic bands, weightlifting, and a STEM club of my own creation.
        Following high school, I plan to attend college and get a degree in mechanical engineering minoring in either music, 
        computer science, or another type of engineering. Nonetheless, I plan to continue completing creation projects no matter 
        where I end up in the future, and thus, continue adding to this website.

            <p>
            Beginning two years ago, I began exploring the world of coding through the use of Codecademy. 
            Although I don't need to know how to code for my intended major, it has always been a keen interest 
            of mine and I see a lot of value in pursuing it. As such, fall semester of 2023 I decided to dual enroll 
            in a coding class taught in python to expand my basic understanding of coding even further. In this class, 
            there are numerous 'labs' and projects which are used to test understanding of the different coding 
            methods. Most of these projects are recorded below as well as their files for download. *As I am currently 
            taking the class, this will continue to be added to until December of 2023*
            <h5 class="section-heading">1.1 Simple Calculator</h5>
            <p>
            This is one of the first 'labs' of the course. Just like the name implies, this is just a calculator which makes 
            calculations using only the four basic math operations using user input. This program was due before I had been taught 
            loops, and thus, needs to be rerun for each new calculation.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-heading">1.2 Scientific Calculator</h5>
            <p>
            Just following the simple calculator 'lab' was the scientific calculator 'lab.' This program features a more advanced 
            use of the loop function to be able to reuse the calculator without the need of rerunning it.
            More advnaced calculations are available such as the logarithm by importing the python math library.
            Furthermore, this calculator stores the results that are previously collected and perform the average of this.

            <h5 class="section-heading">1.3 Hexadecimal and Binary Converter</h5>
            <p>
            Building upon the functions used in the prior 'labs' the hexadecimal and binary number converter 
            can be used to perform a number of functions when given either a hexadecimal or binary number. 
            This program implores the use of functions to create more readable code and simplify further the process.
            The creation of this specific program took a lot of trial and error on my part; however, the final result 
            is a program that can convert hexadecimal and binary numbers to decimal numers, and also convert a hexadecimal 
            number to a binary number given all based on a given user's input.

            <h4 class="project-type">2. Projects for IB</h4>
            <p>
            Throughout the IB (International Baccalaureate) program, IB candidates are required 
            to complete IAs (Internal Assessments) which are papers/projects for each specific class, and an EE 
            (Extended Essay) which is a research paper on a topic of the candidate's choosing. 
            Recorded below are a few of my favorite IAs that were completed throughout my time in the IB program.
            </p>
            <h5 class="section-heading">2.1 EE: Opioid Epidemic Research Paper</h5>
            <p>
            For my EE topic I chose to do a research paper on the Opioid Epidemic through the means of a case study 
            between California and West Virginia. Both of these states have faced the Opioide Epidemic, but to much different 
            extents. Consequently, this paper delves into the causes for the varying severities of each epidemic such as: 
            socio-economic, poltical, and educational factors. Furthermore, I also delve into the ways that each state has been 
            managing their respective crises.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The full research paper can be found <a href="" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
            <br>
            <h5 class="section-heading">2.2 Chemistry IA: Electrolysis Experimentation</h5>
            <p>
            For my chemistry IA, I did an experiment involving the electrolysis of water using varying 
            concentrations of the catalyst KOH (potassium hydroxide) to figure out how this effects the volume of HHO produced. The device used for the electrolysis 
            is the HHO generator (further explained below). Unfortunately the data collection was limited 
            because the power supply I had access to self-regulated itself and would shutoff in the middle of trials 
            therefore data had to be extrapulated using long trials averaged where outliers were removed and an average was taken (more information is contained in the full report).

            <br>
            <h5 class="section-heading">2.4 Music IA: Compositions and Paper</h5>
            <p>
            As I have been heavily involved in music all my life, I decided to take the IB music class.
            In this class there were multiple parts of the IA including several compositions, a musical exploration (report), 
            and adaptations of pre-existing music. Contained above are pictures of the scores of a few of the compositions 
            included in this project. The rest of the project can be found using the link to the google drive folder below.

            <h4 class="project-type">3. Project S.P.A.R.K. Experiments/Projects</h4>
            <p>
            When I was in 6th grade I was fortunate enough to be a part of a project-based STEM class. 
            As time has gone on however, the resources available to children in Flagler County (my home county) 
            have decreased dramatially. As such, I co-founded a STEM enrichment club, Project S.P.A.R.K.,
            which has currently been implemented in three of the Title I elementary schools in Flagler County. 
            The primary goal of project S.P.A.R.K. has been to 'spark' the imaginations, creativity, critical-thinking, 
            and problem solving skills of the children involved. Since experiences as a kid can have a huge impact on 
            their future aspirations, it is of the utmost importance to stimulate these young minds. Who knows, maybe one 
            day the children touched by S.P.A.R.K. will one day become scientists or engineers making world changing advancements.

            <h5 class="section-heading">3.1 School Launch Days</h5>
            <p>Located above are some pictures from the highly successful launch days.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            As myself and the other co-founders planned ways to implement what we had thought of in the 2022-2023 school year, 
            we decided that it would be best to go to one school towards the end of the year and work with their students on 
            mini-projects to generate interest and test the viability. Myself and nine of my classmates went to Bunnell Elementary 
            school and ran a project with their 2nd, 3rd, and 4th graders following the standards they had learned throughout 
            the school year. With the 2nd graders we made rain clouds in jars, with the 3rd graders we created oobleck, and last but not least, 
            with the 4th graders we made spaghetti and marshmallow towers. Although relatively simple in nature, the students showed immense 
            interest and seemed to succesfully draw connections to what they had been learning in the classroom. Based on these reactions alone, 
            we decided that this project was more than worth our time. We are inspiring our world's future.

            <h4 class="project-type">4. Independent Projects</h4>
            <p>
            As I have grown older, creation has become an important aspect of my identity. I always find myself 
            trying to get my hands messy with whatever project idea I come up with. While I haven't had the most time, 
            I still try to feed my internal DIYer urges through whatever means possible.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5 class="section-heading">4.1 HHO Generator</h5>
            <p>
            When I was a kid I had seen a video on the creation of an HHO generator. Although I didn't know it then, 
            I would soon learn that this process of splitting water into its constituent componets was called electrolysis. 
            Ever since that day, I have been fascinated with this subject and the multitude of uses that arise from the hydrogen 
            and oxygen gas that is produced. When I finally had the resources and know-how, I built my own version of an HHO generator 
            (still heavily based upon the presentation of The King of Random's). This is the starter to a series of projects that I intend 
            to build in the future which will run on the gasses produced by the generator. For example, I intend to create a mini hydroxy torch 
            which will be run using the gasses from the HHO generator itself. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5 class="section-heading">4.2 Project Truck</h5>
            <p>
            Three years ago, my dad proposed the idea of doing a project truck which would be my first car. Although the project did not become 
            my first car, it still has been an immense amount of fun to complete with my dad. Being a certified Master Technician (master of all 
            if I do say so myself), my dad has taught me a multitude of skills while working on the truck which I have been able to apply 
            to some of my other projects. I have learned how to use a large portion of all the tools in our garage, and the true 
            determination that it often takes to complete a project to fruition. Witnessing the evolution of the truck from its origins 
            as multiple vehicles (we completely dissambled another similar truck for parts) to its almost completed state now has 
            been an amazing experience that will always stick with me whenever I need to DIY anything in the future.

            <h5 class="section-heading">4.3 Website Portfolio</h5>
            <p>
            To properly document all of the projects I have done and also practice coding skills that I have learned through the use 
            of Codecademy, I decided to create this website. I'm still currently learning the methodology involved in coding for 
            websites (therefore this is not the prettiest) however, it has been a great opportunity to code something that can be 
            added, and is overall very useful. As I complete more projects, this website will continue tochange because it is always a work in 
            progress.
